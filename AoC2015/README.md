# Advent of Code 2015

My solutions for each day of AoC 2015

As mentioned in the main README, this year I have done all Ruby. It's been great learning it's capabilities (and drawbacks, see Day 10).

### [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1) 

This one was an quick and easy starter to the year. Not much to say about it!

### [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/2) 

Another pretty simple one. Just a bit of arithmetic.

### [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/3) 

Yet another simple one! I did learn how to do a conditional operator in Ruby though so that's a plus

### [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/4) 

This one was interesting. Before this, I had never messed with hashes or anything so that was cool. I also learned a bit about type conversions and hex in Ruby here too.
**EDIT**: HaHa! I am now in a Sodtware Reverse Engineering class and used my knowledge of hashes for a malware analysis assignment!

### [Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/5) 

This one was odd. I did use ChatGPT to kinda give me a push. It lead me to learning about the .scan tool and .empty? so that was nice.

### [Day 6](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/6) 

MORE REGEX!!! I *still* consider them regex pros wizards. This one was cool though.

### [Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/7) 

Okay, I started this one and then gave up halfway through. I'll get back to it, swear.

### [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/8) 

This was neat. Learned more about string manipulation in Ruby so that's helpful.

### [Day 9](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/9) 

This used some heavy help from Mr. ChatGPT, can't lie. I haven't coded in a while and this one just truly stumped me for reasons beyond my understanding.

### [Day 10](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/10) 

AHHHHH! I have found the severe drawback to Ruby. It's slow as a turtle in tar. Part 1 got done in about 10 seconds and I had to cut Part 2 off at about 20 minutes.
It was a pretty easy puzzle in terms of like actually programming it but by god my patience was tested.

### [Day 11](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/11) 

Heavy AI used here again. I'm still getting back into the groove and I feel like as I go through the puzzles, they keep getting harder.
I learned a bit here but it was more of formatting and/or unique was to do things that are in Ruby that I just didn't know about.
