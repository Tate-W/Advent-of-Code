# Advent of Code 2015 - Ruby

My solutions for each day of AoC 2015

As mentioned in the main README, this year I have done all Ruby. It's been great learning it's capabilities (and drawbacks, see Day 10).

### [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1) 

This one was an quick and easy starter to the year. Not much to say about it!

### [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/2) 

Another pretty simple one. Just a bit of arithmetic.

### [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/3) 

Yet another simple one! I did learn how to do a conditional operator in Ruby though so that's a plus

### [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/4) 

This one was interesting. Before this, I had never messed with hashes or anything so that was cool. I also learned a bit about type conversions and hex in Ruby here too.
**EDIT**: HaHa! I am now in a Sodtware Reverse Engineering class and used my knowledge of hashes for a malware analysis assignment!

### [Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/5) 

This one was odd. I did use ChatGPT to kinda give me a push. It lead me to learning about the .scan tool and .empty? so that was nice.

### [Day 6](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/6) 

MORE REGEX!!! I *still* consider them regex pros wizards. This one was cool though.

### [Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/7) 

Okay, I started this one and then gave up halfway through. I'll get back to it, swear.

### [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/8) 

This was neat. Learned more about string manipulation in Ruby so that's helpful.

### [Day 9](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/9) 

This used some heavy help from Mr. ChatGPT, can't lie. I haven't coded in a while and this one just truly stumped me for reasons beyond my understanding.

### [Day 10](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/10) 

AHHHHH! I have found the severe drawback to Ruby. It's slow as a turtle in tar. Part 1 got done in about 10 seconds and I had to cut Part 2 off at about 20 minutes.
It was a pretty easy puzzle in terms of like actually programming it but by god my patience was tested.

### [Day 11](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/11) 

Heavy AI used here again. I'm still getting back into the groove and I feel like as I go through the puzzles, they keep getting harder.
I learned a bit here but it was more of formatting and/or unique was to do things that are in Ruby that I just didn't know about.

### [Day 12](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/12)

TBD

### [Day 13](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/13)

TBD

### [Day 14](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/14)

This one was enjoyable! I was helping a friend with his CSC class and decided to do this puzzle in the meantime. It was fun to sit down and properly program again after so long(5 months since last commit fyi). Part 1 I did myself and even wrote it out logically on paper to figure out how I wanted to do it. Part 2 was made with my friend Mr.GPT. It did give me a chance to look at how I could improve part 1 but I elected to keep it how it was for posterity sake
