# Premise
I found [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/about) through a friend and started on 2023 in randomly selected languages.
This was fun but when I got **Ruby** as a language, I really started to enjoy it and wanted to learn more.
I temporarily put a hold on AoC2023 and moved back to the earliest AoC, AoC2015.

I decided to do all of AoC2015 in Ruby as a way to learn it with fun puzzles.
When I complete AoC2015, I will move on to AoC2016 in a different language (possibly Rust but I haven't decided yet).
Eventually, I will return to AoC2023 and finish the random languages, or maybe I will do it in between other years as a way to find a new one to learn more.
This repo will be holding every day of AoC from each year that I do, from now on for as long as I participate in AoC.

There should be (if I get around to it) a README in each year's folder with the used language and thoughts from each puzzle just as a little idea of what the puzzle is about.

## AI
I did use generative AI, such as ChatGPT, at some points of this process as a tool to help with specific issues I was having with the puzzles. 
I personally think this is the way it should be used for now, but hey maybe in the future I won't have a job.
