# Premise
I found [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/about) through a friend and started on 2023 in randomly selected languages.
This was fun but when I got **Ruby** as a language, I really started to enjoy it and wanted to learn more.
I temporarily put a hold on AoC2023 and moved back to the earliest AoC, AoC2015.

I decided to do all of AoC2015 in Ruby as a way to learn it with fun puzzles.
When I complete AoC2015, I will move on to AoC2016 in a different language (possibly Rust but I haven't decided yet).
Eventually, I will return to AoC2023 and finish the random languages, or maybe I will do it in between other years as a way to find a new one to learn more.

**This repo will be holding every day of AoC from each year that I do, from now on for as long as I participate in AoC.**

I should also mention that most of the puzzles just have the finished Part 2, others have them seperated as comments and some are just implemented as add-on functions or within the main body.
I was just too lazy to code in a whole new Part 2 function if all I had to do was change like 1 variable value or some simple add-on. 
[AoC2023 - Day 6](https://github.com/Tate-W/Advent-of-Code/blob/main/AoC2023/Day%206/day6.rb) is a good example of what I should do versus [AoC2015 - Day 2](https://github.com/Tate-W/Advent-of-Code/blob/main/AoC2015/Day%202/day2.rb) or [AoC2015 - Day 5](https://github.com/Tate-W/Advent-of-Code/blob/main/AoC2015/Day%205/day5.rb), which is mostly what I have done.

There should be (if I get around to it) a README in each year's folder with the used language (for AoC 2023 and if I decide to go random for another year) and thoughts from each puzzle just as a little idea of what I thought about it and what I learned.

## AI
I did use generative AI, such as ChatGPT, at some points of this process as a tool to help with specific issues I was having with the puzzles. I will try to mention it in the yearly READMEs by day but I may forget. 
I personally think this is the way it should be used for now, but hey maybe in the future I won't have a job.

## Me
I am a current CompSci student planning to graduate Spring 2025.
I started college in 2020 as a MechE - Mechatronics major, then dropped Mechatronics, then added an Aquatics minor and dropped it almost immediatly, then switched to CmpE for 2 years, realized I didn't like the topics of the rest of my classes, and finally switched to CompSci with a ECE/CmpE minor after Fall 2023.
I know, quite the journey, but I am excited for the rest of my classes and that's all that matters to me.
