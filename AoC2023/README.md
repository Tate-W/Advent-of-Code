# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions for each day of AoC 2023

I have decided to do a [spin-a-wheel](https://wheelofnames.com/hxj-vh9) to choose the language of each day to try and challenge myself and grow my knowledge in a wide variety of languages.

### [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1) - C++

This is the lanuguage I am most proficient in.
It provided little challenge but was fun to get back into since I haven't used C++ in about a year.
The Regex was the harshest part of this problem for me. Regex masters are now considered wizards of the dark arts by my standards.

### [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2) - Python

I haven't used Python much in my career but it was very fun to play with for this!
The implementation of logic was super easy and this problem was solved fairly quickly.

### [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3) - C#

C# is very similar to when I used C for microcomputer systems.
It was quick to pick up on but still quite the challenge.

### [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4) - Ruby
